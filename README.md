## Contributing

If you have a log file which you'd like added, create a GitHub issue and attach
said log file to the issue. Same goes for UX or bug reports - just create an
issue and I'll review at some point in the future.

## Development

2. `make build` to build the parser (requires Go)
3. `make parse` to generate metadata files for each log
4. `make server` to run the web server
5. `open localhost:5555` to view your handywork
