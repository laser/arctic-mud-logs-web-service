Before jump chat

Swine tells you 'theres two paths, one is we kill you and consuela, the other is we declare war on myth in its entirity. im not sure arranged fights are an option right now'
You tell Swine 'just kill me and justin'
You tell Swine 'arranged fights is so 
that we don't jump rqs'
Swine tells you 'thats non negotiable, you're both hunted for the rest of the 
wipe for your treachery'
You tell Swine 'i have no probs with 
that'
Swine tells you 'as for "jumping rqs", attack any of us with a myth tag and we'll 
be stomping that whole clan'
You tell Swine 'i don't see a problem 
there, our main targets are va pzc and am'
Swine tells you 'you can do whatever you want if you and whoever else wants to 
attack us drop myth tags, but liek i said. if any MYTH tags attack ANY rq, ill 
personally lead a war effort to butcher every last one of them. we've been way 
too kinda to myth over the las'
Swine tells you 'last few months to tolerate any of this bullshit'
You tell Swine 'no idea why you are so 
mad at us, rqs were never targetted'
You tell Swine 'cos we have respect for 
all your have done for us'
Swine tells you 'you and consuela killed dooku and attacked classic without 
provocation or warning'
Swine tells you 'i fail to see how that is not targetting rqs'You tell Swine 'we went in to kill 
clytemnestra, dooku was too honorable and started attacking consuela'
Swine tells you 'if theres 4 myth with 1 russian and we come in and kill you all, 
does that mean we werent targetting myth?'
You tell Swine 'our plan was to kill 
clyt and get out, ppl who didn't assist wouldn't have gotten hit'
You tell Swine 'wasn't that how clan 
wars go'
Swine tells you 'oh so its a clan war'
Swine tells you 'and no thats not how things go. if you kill a member of a large 
clan you can expect a backlash. just because we've helped your clan a lot does 
not mean you can kill our members and think its "acceptable collateral damage" 
for some feud we have nothin'
Swine tells you 'to do with'
You tell Swine 'well thing is dooku 
shouldn't have assisted, and he was in our group just now and we talked abit'
Swine tells you 'you both aggro'd classic, one of the inner circle and leaders of 
our clan for no reason. he didnt even cast'
Swine tells you 'that was a big mistake'
You tell Swine 'have you'
You tell Swine 'had a chance to take a look 
at the log'
Swine tells you 'i dont need to'
You tell Swine 'dooku died, classic wasn't 
targetted, classic cold snapped everyone in the room'
Swine tells you 'and so he should when you're pkilling rqs'
Swine tells you 'look you can say whatever you want, i really dont give a shit. 
two myth killed an rq with no provocation, thats the fact and thats what 
happened'
You tell Swine 'i agree'
You tell Swine 'no use arguing'
Swine tells you 'the only reason we havent declared open season is because we're 
on friendly terms with myth'
Swine tells you 'but dont mistake kindness for weakness, on small mistep and 
we'll kill you all.'

couldn't loot, justin accidentally bone shaped'

You tell Swine 'we return gear when we get our 
flags off'
Swine tells you 'we dont want our gear back'
You tell Swine 'well i for hell not renting this 
stuff'

you and all myth until i stop playing'

instead i tried to do the right thing and you just fucked us again'

were there'

You tell Liza 'yes but you told us you would hunt 
us regardless'
Liza tells you 'after everything this clan has done for myth you guys are 
dispiciable scums'
You tell Liza 'and justin said you would kill 
anyone you like'
Liza tells you 'if you even think that this is in any way justified, i feel bad 
for your moral'
Liza tells you 'good luck explaining this to refaat'
Liza tells you '"well rq tried to kill consuela because we killed dooku and 
attacked classic... so we got more tagged myths and ambushed them mid zone"'
You tell Liza 'like i said, we would return eq, and 
we would have no probs you hunt me justin and frank'
Liza tells you 'get fucked'
Liza tells you 'you're whole clan is done'
You tell Liza 'i don't really understand why are 
you so angry and want to kill myths who have nothing to do with this'
Liza tells you 'you brought them into it'
Liza tells you 'now its an open war'
You tell Liza 'i told refaat we would quit myth cos 
of this, he kept insisting i put back the tag'
Liza tells you 'it doesnt even matter if you leave the clan now'
Liza tells you 'i dont want my gear, i dont want justification. i just want you 
to know your scum, ill never forget this, and ill hunt you and myth forever.'
