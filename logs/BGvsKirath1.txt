Beyond the City of Kalaman
    Just beyond the western gates of Kalaman, the trail splits into two

the west. The fields in this area are bountiful in the summer and lie
fallow during the winter, but all year long life abounds here. The grasses
rustle from the wind softly blowing in from the bay. To the north there is
a old rickety fence surrounding what appears to be a graveyard.

manure. Around you grass is blown in the wind, growing thicker as it leads

path cuts north, further into the widening fields, and south towards a

it makes its way to the sea. The grasses here are sparse and mixed in with
sandy dunes. Scattered among the dunes are pieces of driftwood that have

The Vingaard River
    The mighty Vingaard river rushes past you as it rushes through the
plains to the south. There is a heavy sent of saltwater to the air, marking
the estuary of the river to the northeast. The river is thinner here, banks
herding the river on its course. On each of the north and south sides of
the rivers, roads lead through the lands towards Palanthas and the Lord
City of Kalaman.

Banks of the Vingaard River
    You are standing on the northern banks of the Vingaard river. The
roaring river flows past you, splashing water near your feet. The river
appears to be too fast and wide for you to cross safely by yourself. As you
survey the river banks around you, you notice a ferry not far from you.
Perhaps you can get a ride across the river on it. Leading away from the
river there is a path heading north.

South of A Junction of Paths
    North of here you can see a junction of roads. South of you lies the
Vingaard river and the ferry that leads across it. Around you the fields
blow in the wind, and small animals scurry around. The road here is made up
of rocks stacked together neatly.

A Junction of Paths
    The road reaches a large fork, branching off in three directions. The
grasses that grow along the Vingaard Estuary blow gently in the seaside
winds. The smell of salt is strong coming from the east, giving the
impression that the Northern Courrain is not far to the east. The northern
trek leads towards a small village on the north shore of the Vingaard
River. Towards the south, the Vingaard River breaks the road, leaving only
a ferry to carry passengers towards the city of Kalaman and the lands
beyond. Looking west, the road winds its course through the plains towards
the distant city of Palanthas.

    This small stone building stands at the junction of the roads from
Palanthas to the west, Kalaman to the east, and Solanthus to the south. A
road leads north to the gates of the City of Vingaard, and east to the main
keep atop the hill. Inside the tollhouse there are some long benches for
those waiting to meet with the tax collector, who sits behind the large
table toward the back. Behind this table is a large safe mounted in the
wall, storing the collected taxes waiting to be added to the city's
coffers. A small staircase leads up to a small hatch in the ceiling.
Travelers wishing to pass must pay the toll, then head west to Palanthas,
north through the city and east to Kalaman, or south toward the Newsea.
A wooden sign on a pole directs travellers to their destinations.

The Knights' High Road
    The Knights' High Road ends here, just west of the city of Vingaard.
The city's massive town wall surrounds the city just to the northeast,
while perched atop a hill to the southeast is the main keep, and impressive
fortification. Large swatches of fertile farmlands surround the town, and a
westsmall road leads off to the north through them. Directly to the east is a

people passing through the area.

The Knights' High Road
    You travel along a very long road, extending as far as you can see
through the seemingly endless Solamnic Plain. The road is wide and
obviously heavily used, though some tracks seem a bit old. The occasional
bird flies high overhead, quietly cruising around searching for prey. A
light breeze blows, carrying the sweet smell of the plains with it. The
road extends west-northwest toward Palanthas and east-southeast to
Vingaard, its keep perched atop a hill barely visible on the horizon.

to the east and Palanthas to the west, extends eastward far beyond your

seems to be dwindling as reports of war gain credibility.

then turns away towards a lake at the heart of this lush valley. Tall green
grasses grow all around, beautiful patterns emerging as the wind blows
their tops back and forth. A large bird occasionally flies by high
overhead, searching for prey. The road stretches east and west through the

the Solamnic Knighthood, stands just to the side of Westgate pass. The
Knight's Spur, a much more recent addition, stretches out across the
northern exit of the pass, protecting the city of Palanthas that lies
beyond. A few snow-capped peaks of the Vingaard Mountains can be seen in
the distance, their impressive heights dwarfed by the massive tower. To the
south, the road leads back down to the plains through the mountains.

The Ebullient Elephant Inn
    This spacious tavern is full of customers. This is obviously a favorite
hangout of many of Palanthas's middle class citizens. There is a bar
against one wall and a staircase leading upstairs to the room clerk's
office. The only exit is back north to Sword Street.
Floyd, the barkeep, idly whistles a merry tune while polishing the bar.
