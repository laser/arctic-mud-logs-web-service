Subject: COB VS. Goda Vos
Date: Sunday, February 08, 1998 8:41 PM

** Goda Vos were on a pkilling streak and slaughtered Moot(my new tank
warrior) in cold ** blood. After deciding to teach those twinks a lesson, me
and Phaze gathered a   
** plan to fight back.  Dave did a really good job controlling merc.
charmies.  We ** blasted those eggheads off right from beginning and kicked
their asses on a 2 on 5
** confrontation. Bandor is Dead! RIP. Khaltok is Dead! RIP. Eamont is Dead!
RIP.
** It is a shame that Kem and Fooj got away. The log also showed Goda Vos
were the     ** aggressors.  Hack, let all the twinks on the mud know death
is the result of messing ** with COB!

You tell Phaze '2 on 2'
