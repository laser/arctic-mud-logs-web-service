mountains, blurry in the heat. A small village is stretched out south of

impression that the Northern Courrain is not far to the east. The northern
trek leads towards a small village on the north shore of the Vingaard
River. Towards the south, the Vingaard River breaks the road, leaving only
a ferry to carry passengers towards the city of Kalaman and the lands
beyond. Looking west, the road winds its course through the plains towards
the distant city of Palanthas.

Kalaman and the Northern Courrain Ocean. The river is fairly wide though
seems a bit narrower in this area, likely the reason a ferry was set up
here. Light shimmers off the water, dancing about the irregularities in the
water's usually smooth surface. A few fish can barely be seen swimming
about.

The Ferry Landing
    A small building has been built here, just north of the road. The
building is apparently there as a living area for the ferry's operators. A
small section of the building's roof extends out over the road to serve as
a place of waiting for the ferry. A small dock juts out into the flowing
waters of the Vingaard, a series of cleats along its edges to tie up the
ferry.
One of the ferry owners stands here, ready to take you across the river.

West Bank of the Vingaard
    A wide road runs from the east gate of Vingaard northward, and then
turns east to a ferry landing. A building stands just to the north of the
landing, a sweet smell coming from its cooking fire. A much smaller road
leads north toward some farmland. The massive city walls rise to the west,
shielding the town from any possible invaders.

West Bank of the Vingaard
    A large road runs along the edge of the Vingaard River, just east of
the City of Vingaard. The road stretches south to the gates of Vingaard
City, and north where it turns east toward a ferry landing. A bit of smoke
drifts over the top of the walls, its pale color visible in the sky. The

Before the Eastern Gates of Vingaard
    Vingaard's immense iron gates stand directly to the west, where they
present a significant obstacle to any attacking force, but currently they
have been raised high to allow passage of people and horses. High stone
walls run north and south from here, extending quite a ways before turning
beyond your vision. A stone highway leads east through the Solamnic plains
and a cobblestone avenue heads west through the gates.

Near a Tollhouse
    The highway runs alongside the west bank of the Vingaard River, below
the high walls of the city itself. The road is heavily rutted as much
traffic passes through the area, and the proximity to the river moistens
the ground. To the west lies a small tollhouse, used in days past to
collect taxes from travellers passing through. Northward the road heads to
the east gate of Vingaard City, and to a ferry crossing the river.

The Tollhouse
    This small stone building stands at the junction of the roads from
Palanthas to the west, Kalaman to the east, and Solanthus to the south. A
road leads north to the gates of the City of Vingaard, and east to the main
keep atop the hill. Inside the tollhouse there are some long benches for
those waiting to meet with the tax collector, who sits behind the large
table toward the back. Behind this table is a large safe mounted in the
wall, storing the collected taxes waiting to be added to the city's
coffers. A small staircase leads up to a small hatch in the ceiling.
Travelers wishing to pass must pay the toll, then head west to Palanthas,
north through the city and east to Kalaman, or south toward the Newsea.
A wooden sign on a pole directs travellers to their destinations.

hordes of weed and grass advancing ruthlessly like an army of barbarians.
The trees, branches covered with the perfumed blooms of the new growth
season, rustle slightly, and the winds whistle their mournful, melodic
ditty. The entire forest seems to come alive with a sudden, and free, flow
of energy, shifting in the wind, moving across the ground with clawed
roots, breathing deeply in the cool air. The tinkling of music, the voices
of the faerie folk, plays its games, hiding behind the trees and darting
into sullen shadows. All is alive, as if the ground you now traverse upon
is a sleeping beast of mammoth proportions. The trail leads to the west
branching off in several times in the distance. In the gloom of the

River of The Dead
    The waters of this once mighty mountain river no longer flow clear and
cool. Over the years, under the hot and torrid sun, this stream has slowly
become tainted, poisons seeping into its humid, brown depths. Some distance
ahead, in the mist and fog of the peaks, rising before the northward path
like the gods of elements, a waterfall can be seen tripping down the sides,
the slopes, of the snow-covered mountains. Most unlike the incessant
murmuring of this fall, the River of The Dead snaps harshly against the
side of the boat, trying to pull itself while gasping for air. The river
continues to the east and, then, seems to curve southward, moving dutifully
out into the sea.

    The undergrowth of the forest floor has overgrown this dirt path,
hordes of weed and grass advancing ruthlessly like an army of barbarians.
The trees, branches covered with the perfumed blooms of the new growth
season, rustle slightly, and the winds whistle their mournful, melodic
ditty. The entire forest seems to come alive with a sudden, and free, flow
of energy, shifting in the wind, moving across the ground with clawed
roots, breathing deeply in the cool air. The tinkling of music, the voices
of the faerie folk, plays its games, hiding behind the trees and darting
into sullen shadows. All is alive, as if the ground you now traverse upon
is a sleeping beast of mammoth proportions. The trail leads to the west
branching off in several times in the distance. In the gloom of the
foliage, barely visible, tiny shacks can be seen.

Secret Path
    The undergrowth of the forest floor has overgrown this dirt path,
hordes of weed and grass advancing ruthlessly like an army of barbarians.
The trees, branches covered with the perfumed blooms of the new growth
season, rustle slightly, and the winds whistle their mournful, melodic
ditty. The entire forest seems to come alive with a sudden, and free, flow
of energy, shifting in the wind, moving across the ground with clawed
roots, breathing deeply in the cool air. The tinkling of music, the voices
of the faerie folk, plays its games, hiding behind the trees and darting
into sullen shadows. All is alive, as if the ground you now traverse upon
is a sleeping beast of mammoth proportions. The trail leads to the west
branching off in several times in the distance. In the gloom of the

Abandoned Shack
    Clouds of dust scatter into the musky air and billow upwards. As the
dirt settles in this small unimpressive shack, ropes of light fall downward
through the thatched roof, and tiny holes in the thatched roof open the
barrier that separates the hut's occupants from the wilderness outside. In
the center of this shack a small pile of wet ashes has been partially
buried; broken, charred twigs peek out of the jumbled, damp mess. Empty of
any material possessions, this shack has not been permanently occupied in
some time. In the distance, melting away with the twitterings of the
woodland birds, a low moan can be heard caressing its way through the
trees. Then, leaving just the minute traces of its spiritual value, the
chant begins to ebb away.

become tainted, poisons seeping into its humid, brown depths. Some distance

like the gods of elements, a waterfall can be seen tripping down the sides,
the slopes, of the snow-covered mountains. Most unlike the incessant
murmuring of this fall, the River of The Dead snaps harshly against the

Sacred Passage
    The trees, the foliage, sparkle in the light, covered in a thin layer
of frost. Seemingly painted on, the frozen dew attaches itself to the oak
trees, swirling patterns turning the hard wood into a natural canvas.
Across the ground, just outside the trail, tiny footprints have been left
behind, and lead in a variety of directions, twisting through the woods. At
your feet, thin ruts are the only signs of passing carts, and they become
deeper as the path continues to the north. Oddly, the wheel tracks only
begin at this point, and, even though the earth has been frozen by the
mountain's frigid winds, the imprints are deeply cut into the black soil.
To the west, hidden behind a tree leaning to one side, its roots being
slowly, tortuously ripped from the forest floor, a pile of brush lies
covered with clumps of snow.

Mountain View
    Stabbing the clear skies, the peaks of the mountains stretch upwards to
the heavens. A ring of clouds encircles the very pinnacle, hugging the cold
rock and protecting the great sheets of ice and snow that blanket the solid
cliffs. Within the clouds, strange shapes flit and soar about, breaking
away from the froth, and, then, meld and mold themselves into contorted
shapes, eventually merging back into their snow-filled homes and
disappearing from sight.

Forest Center
    A mighty oak tree dominates the center of the path. Spreading its
ice-covered branches upwards toward the sky, the long, gnarled fingers hang
over the surrounding area as a mother protecting her children. Scarred and
colored a fading brown, the trunk has become firmly embedded in the forest
floor over the last several hundred years. Walking past it, stiff blades of
frozen grass crumble and shatter beneath your feet, the freezing
temperatures beginning to numb your toes. In the distance, the sobs of a
crying female can be heard. Past these sounds, to the north, the path
allows you to move closer to the mountains.

Rocky Trail
    The mud and dirt have now given away to a thick covering of white
gravel. Alongside the trail, small clusters of green grass flap in the wind
like tiny battle flags, and clumps of snow lie melting in the sun. The air,
once warm, has become dry and cool, your breath shooting out in plumes of
hot steam. Branches droop dangerously over the path, the leaves covered in
a thin layer of frozen dew, and icicles, as sharp as daggers, hang from the
wood, sparkling in the light.

A Clearing
    Suddenly opening up, the path cuts across a large area cleared of any
major, and natural, obstacles. Rising from the green grass, erupting in a
shower of stone, a large cliff curls about this clearing. Against the
cliff, a waterfall showers down onto the rocks, and disappears underneath
the fertile land, flowing to realms unknown. Bubbling incessantly, the
crystalline liquid rests momentarily amongst a small patch of reeds hugging
the base of the cliff. In the middle of the clearing, a circular patch of
dead grass has been cleared by intelligent hands, the center being coated
with soot and half-burnt logs. Obviously, this clearing has served as a
camping ground for travellers.

Natural Net
    A fine mist, tiny droplets of rainwater, shuffle to the earth, and run
down the trunks of the trees in tiny rivulets. Placing your hand upon the
wet bark, you can feel warmth spewing out of the wood and into your
fingers. Distant, deep within the core of the wood, a steady, rhythmic beat
vibrates throughout these wooden pillars. Alive and muttering its tales
into the wind, the pulse of these great, wooden giants seems to lead the
forest in a strange primeval dance yet to be understood.

Forest Path
    Vines like great serpents hang precariously from the lower branches of
the trees. Coiling and squeezing, the thin, green ropes have woven
themselves into a natural tapestry. A thick, chaotic knot, this forest
curtain separates the civilized from the wild. Brushing aside the numerous
strands, trying to peer into the forest's inner depths, one can only see
the shifting of shadows as the angle of natural light is altered.

Northern Path
    The forest presses inward, pushing and shoving at the small, dirty
trail. Ancient trees line the path, reaching out and digging their hard
roots, like tentacles, into the muddy forest floor. The uneasy roar of
silence overwhelms the sweet chirpings of a Thrush, and pushes its way
through the forest undergrowth, rushing over your feet like tiny waves.
Breathing in the humid air, a sensation of drowning overcomes you, broken
only by the occasional cool breeze from the south.

Elven Arch
    A breeze, carrying the scent of wildflowers, washes gently over you,
and departs with the quietest of whispers. Overhead, the white clouds mold
and twist themselves, splashing against the shores of heavens unseen. The
azure sky, peeking carefully between frothy, white lumps, begins to show
the first signs of night as darkness begins to pull itself across the
horizon. Retreating, the sun offers the land its warmth, beams of gold
slicing through the cool air. Ahead, the forest begins to pull together,
trees crowding against each other, and vines twisting about the
moss-covered trunks, creating a wall of vegetation. Strangely, it seems
that some of the forest has become interlaced into a poetic arch, crossing
the space just above you. Through this arch, the trail continues to the
north.

The weather is harsh and the sky is a gloomy gray. It is very hard to
navigate though the turbulent waters large waves and strong waves seem to
cover most of this sea. The waters here seem unnaturally dark and you see
few signs of life. The Newsea, created during the Cataclysm, now separates
Solamnia and Abanasinia.

heads south through some grain fields. Off to the south you can see a dense
pine forest. Newsea spreads out before you to the north, west and east from

At the Edge of Nearfields
    You are on a narrow trail that cuts between large fields of grain and
the huge vallenwood trees that cover the Solace Vale. Stretching out to the
north, these fields are known as Nearfields to the citizens of Solace
because of their proximity to the small town. A thick forest of pine trees
lies to the west, beyond which the Crystalmir Lake can be seen. To the east
this dirt trail merges with a wide road.

that Solace is a part of. You know, however, that it is much wilder and
dangerous. Northern Avenue leads south into the heart of Solace.

    Solace Square is a large clearing that is surrounded on all sides by
huge vallenwood trees. These trees stretch far above the ground and their
limbs provide cover and shelter to the inhabitants of Solace. The clearing
here rises slightly towards the center of the square, providing a high spot
in the center. Small roads have been cut into the dense forest to the
north, south, east, and west. On one edge of the square, there is a huge
vallenwood which is home to what appears to be a guild hall of some sorts.
A small spiral stairway leads up around the trunk of the tree and into the
thick limbs which house the guild hall.

off through the badlands to the lands of Throt beyond.

Near a Crumbling City
    The dreary city of Jelek rises before you to the north, past a small
path that leads to the southern gates of the city. The road itself winds
off into the mountains to the east, disappearing among the rocky barren
slopes. The Khalkists loom all around, falling away only to the west.

Passing Between the Khalkists
    The mountains loom all around, trying to swallow the weary traveler in
their barren vastness. The occasional wind from the north brings the smell
of smoke, hinting that there may be a town just past a barely visible pass.
To the east the rocky slopes swallow the road whole, spitting it out every
now and then as it passes over rocky outcroppings.

Base of a Narrow Climb
    Here the road is widened a bit, a staging area for the merchant wagons
that have to brave the steep climb of the road as it heads up into the
mountains. To the west it travels a bit easier, picking its way along less
steep slopes. A few broken wheels and oxen bones break up the rocky
eastmonotony of the road, showing that not every merchant successfully made his
way down.

Crossing a Narrow Trail
    The thin air stings your lungs slightly as the high altitude makes
itself known. The road wanders along a narrow ridge heading east. Looking
east, the road goes straight down in a steep descent every merchant dreads,
easy to walk but a nightmare for any wagon or cart.

Atop a Sharp Descent
    A stiff breeze is the only thing to the east, as the mountain drops off
sharper than a knife could cut. Far below birds are visible, circling to
find anything stupid enough to be blown off the mountain. The road travels
pretty much straight down, zigzagging down a path literally cut out of the
eastrock. To the west it stays level a bit, but promises a similar descent.

Breaching the Steep Climb
    A cliff rises so steeply here that the occasional pebble plunks you on
the head, falling from great heights without even a single bounce. The road
is literally cut into the side of the cliff, zigzagging up the steep face.
To the east it descends a bit more, still rocky but with a much gentler
slope.

Through a Narrow Trail
    The bleak Khalkists loom around, flaunting their steep, barren slopes
to all who pass by. To the west the road approaches an impossibly steep
cliff, rearing its way skywards at an impossibly steep angle. To the east
the road descends along a gentle but rugged slope, and promises to drop a
lot more in short order.

Traversing the Slope
    The rocky road picks its way across the barren slopes, desperately
searching for the easiest path. To the west it slopes upwards gently,
skittering over the broken ground. Southwards it hits a steep descent,
promising an easier way further on as it tries to hug lesser slopes.

Curving Around the Higher Peaks
    The Khalkists loom high, their highest peaks casting huge shadows over
their barren neighbors. To the west the rocky road slopes upwards into
rockier terrain, while southwards a sulfuric smell lies in the slightly
warmer than normal air.

Beside A Deadly Volcano
    What road there is disappears in the drifting volcanic ash, so that to
the north only a path remains. To the south, a poorly visible road hugs the
side of the volcano, curving out of sight. The air is smoky, and every now
and then a slight tremor shakes the ground under your feet.

Beside a Deadly Volcano
    Bits of ashes blow across the road, emissions from the huge volcano to

become treacherous as they slowly fill up with soft ash and become hidden.
All around other bare jagged peaks tower about, casting harsh shadows over
the land.

In View of a Dark City
    The road cuts through the mighty Khalkists, covered in the prints of
many boots. The road leads north past the heart of the Khalkists and south
towards the dark city of Neraka. The mountain range looms high above,
craggy and barren. Birds of prey can be seen hovering above, waiting for
the carnage of war. The air is filled with a thick film, possibly coming
from one of the semi-active volcanoes in the region.

Before the Northern Gate of Neraka
    The dark city of Neraka spreads out to the south, the dark minions of
Takhisis filling the streets. A twisted dark spire rises in the middle of
the city, the pinnacle of the Queen's temple. The craggy peaks of the
Khalkist mountains rise around the city, adding their shadows to the film
of ash that floats through the air.

several blocks are missing and cracks have appeared. The gates are welcome

has been ruthlessly burnt, signs of campfires and tent markings suggest

many boots. The road leads north past the heart of the Khalkists and south
towards the dark city of Neraka. The mountain range looms high above,
craggy and barren. Birds of prey can be seen hovering above, waiting for
the carnage of war. The air is filled with a thick film, possibly coming

    Here the road is widened a bit, a staging area for the merchant wagons
that have to brave the steep climb of the road as it heads up into the
mountains. To the west it travels a bit easier, picking its way along less
steep slopes. A few broken wheels and oxen bones break up the rocky
monotony of the road, showing that not every merchant successfully made his
way down.

paths, one leading to the south around Kalaman, the other leading off to
the west. The fields in this area are bountiful in the summer and lie
fallow during the winter, but all year long life abounds here. The grasses
rustle from the wind softly blowing in from the bay. To the north there is
a old rickety fence surrounding what appears to be a graveyard.

winds. The smell of salt is strong coming from the east, giving the
impression that the Northern Courrain is not far to the east. The northern
trek leads towards a small village on the north shore of the Vingaard
River. Towards the south, the Vingaard River breaks the road, leaving only
a ferry to carry passengers towards the city of Kalaman and the lands
beyond. Looking west, the road winds its course through the plains towards
the distant city of Palanthas.

The Vingaard River
    The clear waters of the Vingaard River gently flow northward, toward
Kalaman and the Northern Courrain Ocean. The river is fairly wide though
seems a bit narrower in this area, likely the reason a ferry was set up
here. Light shimmers off the water, dancing about the irregularities in the
water's usually smooth surface. A few fish can barely be seen swimming
about.

The Ferry Landing
    A small building has been built here, just north of the road. The
building is apparently there as a living area for the ferry's operators. A
small section of the building's roof extends out over the road to serve as
a place of waiting for the ferry. A small dock juts out into the flowing
waters of the Vingaard, a series of cleats along its edges to tie up the
ferry.

    A wide road runs from the east gate of Vingaard northward, and then
turns east to a ferry landing. A building stands just to the north of the

leads north toward some farmland. The massive city walls rise to the west,
shielding the town from any possible invaders.

    Vingaard's immense iron gates stand directly to the west, where they
present a significant obstacle to any attacking force, but currently they
have been raised high to allow passage of people and horses. High stone
walls run north and south from here, extending quite a ways before turning
beyond your vision. A stone highway leads east through the Solamnic plains
and a cobblestone avenue heads west through the gates.

Near a Tollhouse
    The highway runs alongside the west bank of the Vingaard River, below
the high walls of the city itself. The road is heavily rutted as much
traffic passes through the area, and the proximity to the river moistens
the ground. To the west lies a small tollhouse, used in days past to
collect taxes from travellers passing through. Northward the road heads to
the east gate of Vingaard City, and to a ferry crossing the river.

The Tollhouse
    This small stone building stands at the junction of the roads from
Palanthas to the west, Kalaman to the east, and Solanthus to the south. A
road leads north to the gates of the City of Vingaard, and east to the main
keep atop the hill. Inside the tollhouse there are some long benches for
those waiting to meet with the tax collector, who sits behind the large
table toward the back. Behind this table is a large safe mounted in the
wall, storing the collected taxes waiting to be added to the city's
coffers. A small staircase leads up to a small hatch in the ceiling.
Travelers wishing to pass must pay the toll, then head west to Palanthas,
north through the city and east to Kalaman, or south toward the Newsea.
A wooden sign on a pole directs travellers to their destinations.

    This small stone building stands at the junction of the roads from
Palanthas to the west, Kalaman to the east, and Solanthus to the south. A
road leads north to the gates of the City of Vingaard, and east to the main
keep atop the hill. Inside the tollhouse there are some long benches for
those waiting to meet with the tax collector, who sits behind the large
table toward the back. Behind this table is a large safe mounted in the
wall, storing the collected taxes waiting to be added to the city's
coffers. A small staircase leads up to a small hatch in the ceiling.
Travelers wishing to pass must pay the toll, then head west to Palanthas,
north through the city and east to Kalaman, or south toward the Newsea.

The West Bank
    The river here runs slower than other parts, and is shallow from being
built up over the thousands of years this area has been populated by
humans. A vital crossing in times of war, this area is essential to control
to wage a campaign in Solamnia. It is often thought a strategic area due
the ease of fording this section of the river. For millennia, armies have
tried to hold this section of the Vingaard in their foolish quests for
world dominance. In times of peace this area is used by traders seeking to
trade goods with the cities of the north. Much traffic heads through the
center of Solamnia at this ford in the river.

    This small stone building stands at the junction of the roads from
Palanthas to the west, Kalaman to the east, and Solanthus to the south. A
road leads north to the gates of the City of Vingaard, and east to the main
keep atop the hill. Inside the tollhouse there are some long benches for
those waiting to meet with the tax collector, who sits behind the large
table toward the back. Behind this table is a large safe mounted in the
wall, storing the collected taxes waiting to be added to the city's
coffers. A small staircase leads up to a small hatch in the ceiling.
Travelers wishing to pass must pay the toll, then head west to Palanthas,
north through the city and east to Kalaman, or south toward the Newsea.
A wooden sign on a pole directs travellers to their destinations.

    This small stone building stands at the junction of the roads from
Palanthas to the west, Kalaman to the east, and Solanthus to the south. A
road leads north to the gates of the City of Vingaard, and east to the main
keep atop the hill. Inside the tollhouse there are some long benches for
those waiting to meet with the tax collector, who sits behind the large
table toward the back. Behind this table is a large safe mounted in the
wall, storing the collected taxes waiting to be added to the city's
coffers. A small staircase leads up to a small hatch in the ceiling.
Travelers wishing to pass must pay the toll, then head west to Palanthas,
north through the city and east to Kalaman, or south toward the Newsea.

    This small stone building stands at the junction of the roads from

road leads north to the gates of the City of Vingaard, and east to the main
keep atop the hill. Inside the tollhouse there are some long benches for
those waiting to meet with the tax collector, who sits behind the large
table toward the back. Behind this table is a large safe mounted in the
wall, storing the collected taxes waiting to be added to the city's
coffers. A small staircase leads up to a small hatch in the ceiling.
Travelers wishing to pass must pay the toll, then head west to Palanthas,
north through the city and east to Kalaman, or south toward the Newsea.
A wooden sign on a pole directs travellers to their destinations.
