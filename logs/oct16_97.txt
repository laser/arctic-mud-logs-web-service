Vallenwood Lane
     The lane widens into the front yard of a large and comfortable-looking
inn.  The inn seems less to have been built as much as grown from the very
ground between the Vallenwood trunks. At the moment, the trees barely reach
the second story windows, but someday they'll tower over the inn's red tile
roof. A large sign hanging over the entrance creaks slightly as it moves in
the breeze.

Vallenwood Lane
     A pleasant lane winds southward through a grove of young Vallenwood
