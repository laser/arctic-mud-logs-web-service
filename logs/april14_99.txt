Ok, basically we (Salvation) got roinked. Our leader argued that we should let them come to 
us, giving them surprise even tho Hilee and myself strongly disagreed. We had 4 fodder casters 
each without area spells, wich were pretty much useless making it 8 on 12. Then their was 
the healer who fled for no reason, wich turned it into 7 on 12 with us having no healers, 
and them with 2 prismers. Getting no heals the entire fight really sucked.
 After they killed hilee and latoya, it was over. I also cannot blame everybody but myself,
the shriners played a trick of walking healer in after battle had begun, totally fucking me
up, on top of the shitty link, hurt a bundle. I think I am the only one who got out alive, from
our side.
