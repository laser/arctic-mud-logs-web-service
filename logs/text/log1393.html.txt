   Northern Road
   The stone tiles of this road have long since lost their form and
   structure: the road here is uneven and cracked, even missing in some
   parts.
   Broken stone and gravel speckle the road, causing each footfall to
   create
   an eery "crunching" sound. The main road runs north, towards the city
   gates, and south, towards the fountain and city square. A smaller road

   would-be attackers from the Plains of Dust. Guards would patrol this

   and often and protected the cities inhabitants from the nomads and
   common
   criminals that dwelled within the Plains. Now the shattered gate stands

   Once, great scholars came to this library to scour over tomes
   containing knowledge of the arcane arts, history, science, mathematics
   and
   countless other subjects. Now all of that is lost. Whatever was not

   A Path Through the Park
   This dry, dusty pathy leads north-south through the old Tarsis park.
   This park was once full of life, a lush, vibrant forest rich with color
   and
   sound, but now it is a desolate, lonely place. The entire west half of
   the
   park has been replaced with a giant crater.

   weapons shop to the south, the inn just a short distance to the west
   and
   the bar to the north, everything a young warrior needed could be found
   here. Now, the only thing left of the building to the north is a pile
   of
   rubble and the shop to the south has long since been deserted.

   Wall Road
   Once there was an immense lookout tower at the northeast corner of
   Tarsis that provided city guards with a vantage point to survey the
   surrounding landscape. That tower collapsed inward, into the city,
   bringing
   a large section of the city wall with it. The entire road leading east
   is
   blocked by the fallen stone and rubble now, the only exits are a road
   leading south into the market, and west towards the northern gate.

   The Ruined Market
   Large, burned out craters speckle the marketplace here serving as an
   indication as to what happened to this mighty city. It is likely this
   area
   was heavily targetted when the city was attacked because of the dense
   population of a crowded marketplace. The surrounding buildings are
   hollowed
   shells of their former glory: walls are filled with large holes, roofs
   have
   collapsed into several of the buildings, entryways have filled with
   rubble.

   All that remains of this once great gate are splinters of wood and

   gates
   once repelled swarms of attackers, but the slow decay of time has
