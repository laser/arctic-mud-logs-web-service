   On a Cool Road
   Amidst the cool breezes and verdant expanses of grasses is this cool
   road. Composed of mulch and dark black soil, the road curves east
   towards
   the Khurman Sea and south towards the Khalkist mountains. This seems to
   be
   a favored RESTING place of travelers, as there are several charred
   circles
   near the path here where the grass grows shorter. A large apple tree
   provides shade over these campsites, as well as food and protection
   from
   the elements. The cool breeze continues, undaunted, rolling in off of
   the
   waves of the Khurman Sea, making you feel relaxed if but for a moment.

   The East Bank of the Thon-Thalas
   Twilight vanishes at the same moment, and night swallows you. Although
   the sky is clear, without a cloud to mar its dark surface, there are no
   stars visible. Neither the red nor silver moon rise. The only light
   comes
   from the river, which seems to gleam with an unwholesome brilliance,
   like a
   ghoul. The forest lies to the east.
