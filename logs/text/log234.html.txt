   Phaon flies south.
   You follow Huuz south.
   A Small Dais
   You stand upon a small stone altar, off of the hallway. Dust lies
   thick upon the ground. You can see the roots of the trees, from the
   hillside above poking the roof high above and the odd piece of dirt
   falls
   to the floor. There is a large statue standing in a small alcove in the
   far corner of the room.
   A large altar stands here behind the statue.
   A mace lies discarded on the ground.
   A dark green candlestick burns softly in the corner of the room.
   You sense a life form.

   You stand in a long, white tunnel. The tunnel seems to be made of
   light, though the light maintains its consistancy. You see the path

   You feel yourself drawn towards the gate
   The light dances as you approach.

   The light begins to fade, and you find yourself........elsewhere.
