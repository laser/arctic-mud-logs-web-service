   Southern Road
   A massive, charred crater is all that remains of the southeastern part
   of the city. Whatever struck this city and left it in its ruined state
   must
   have rivaled the destructive force of the Cataclysm to have levelled
   this
   large a section of the city. Despite it's poor condition, the road
   leading
   west is in much better condition than the road that once lead eastward.

   Old Tarsis Square
   Dead, dry moss fills the cracks near the remains of the old Tarsis
   fountain. The ruined fountain has long since dried up and is a broken
   shell
   of its former glory. The stone tiles that made up this square are
   shattered
   and broken; weeds have broken through some of the tiles and misplaced
   others, but even those are long-since dead, much like the rest of the
   city.

   The city square lies just to the south, where the sounds of children
   laughing and other familiar city sounds filled the air. Now there is an
   eery silence, save for the noises that you make. This road runs
   north-south, joining the cities fountain with the it's northern gate,
   while
   a narrow street leads east, towards the remains of an important looking
   building.

   an
   air of importance and authority. One of the main city roads lies to the
   west, while the road leads eastward, towards the cities former markets.

   The state of the road has long since fallen from its former grace. This
   once busy, bustling market road has seen few travelers in recent times.
   Skeletons of the buildings that once bordered the road are all that is
   left, save the restaurant to the east that has somehow, miraculously
   survived all this time.

   Pierre's Fine Tarsis Ham
   Somehow, this restaurant has survived the devastation, destruction and
   decay of time and remains as immaculate as the day it was last seen on
   Krynn. The fragrant scent of ham still lingers in the air, making your
   mouth water and your stomach growl. Some divine power has protected
   this
   place, and for reasons unknown to you, this place feels very important.

   Weeds separated and broken through the stone tiles that once made up

   footfall
   echoes through the shattered, skeletal remains of the buildings to the

   East Gate
   All that remains of this once great gate are splinters of wood and
   broken stone. Portions of the archway that once framed the gate have
   collapsed and there are gaping holes in the thick city walls. These
   gates
   once repelled swarms of attackers, but the slow decay of time has
   broken it
   down. The path that once lead to the southeastern portion of town ends
   in a
   sudden drop-off; only a gaping crater remains where the buildings once
   stood tall.

   Wall Road
   Once there was an immense lookout tower at the northeast corner of
   Tarsis that provided city guards with a vantage point to survey the
   surrounding landscape. That tower collapsed inward, into the city,
   bringing
   a large section of the city wall with it. The entire road leading east
   is
   blocked by the fallen stone and rubble now, the only exits are a road
   leading south into the market, and west towards the northern gate.

   North Gate
   The northern gate of Tarsis once stood as an inpenetrable boundary to
   would-be attackers from the Plains of Dust. Guards would patrol this
   area
   and often and protected the cities inhabitants from the nomads and
   common
   criminals that dwelled within the Plains. Now the shattered gate stands
   as
   an eternal testament to their failure: the gate itself has long been
   torn
   out of its frame and shattered onto the stone road of the city.

   remains of the supporting beams and the ladder that were once used to

   North Gate
   The northern gate of Tarsis once stood as an inpenetrable boundary to
   would-be attackers from the Plains of Dust. Guards would patrol this
   area
   and often and protected the cities inhabitants from the nomads and
   common
   criminals that dwelled within the Plains. Now the shattered gate stands
   as
   an eternal testament to their failure: the gate itself has long been
   torn
   out of its frame and shattered onto the stone road of the city.

   Wall Road
   Once there was an immense lookout tower at the northeast corner of
   Tarsis that provided city guards with a vantage point to survey the
   surrounding landscape. That tower collapsed inward, into the city,
   bringing
   a large section of the city wall with it. The entire road leading east
   is
   blocked by the fallen stone and rubble now, the only exits are a road
   leading south into the market, and west towards the northern gate.

   population of a crowded marketplace. The surrounding buildings are

   Wall Road
   Once there was an immense lookout tower at the northeast corner of
   Tarsis that provided city guards with a vantage point to survey the
   surrounding landscape. That tower collapsed inward, into the city,
   bringing
   a large section of the city wall with it. The entire road leading east
   is
   blocked by the fallen stone and rubble now, the only exits are a road
   leading south into the market, and west towards the northern gate.

   The faint smell of decaying trash wafts in from the west on an unfelt

   The Tarsis Dump
   A forsaken desert surrounds you, swallows you whole with its forceful
   gales that hurl grains of sand deep into your skin. It is as if the
   wind is
   penetrating your bones. Scattered pieces of brick and stone have been
   discarded here in the dump. Where once a steady stream of horse-drawn
   cart
   would carry the refuse of tarsis to this forsaken landfill, nothing
   stirs.
   There is little here that is still useful, but the ancient bones of
   what
   you can assume were vagrants lie amidst the trash, with the hopes of
   their
   once peaceful lives covered with filth.

   Forgotten Park
   The Tarsis park has fallen to ruin through years of neglect and decay.
   Dry, withered stumps are all that remains of the majestic trees that
   once
   grew here. There is a very wide crack to the east, making it impossible
   to
   move further in that direction.

   Old Tarsis Square
   Dead, dry moss fills the cracks near the remains of the old Tarsis
   fountain. The ruined fountain has long since dried up and is a broken
   shell
   of its former glory. The stone tiles that made up this square are
   shattered
   and broken; weeds have broken through some of the tiles and misplaced
   others, but even those are long-since dead, much like the rest of the

   East Gate
   All that remains of this once great gate are splinters of wood and

   collapsed and there are gaping holes in the thick city walls. These
   gates
   once repelled swarms of attackers, but the slow decay of time has

   Before the Library
   Two large wooden double doors in the southern wall once opened to
   scholars seeking the knowledge and wisdom that was housed within the
   Great
   Tarsis Library. Now only a single, beaten door remains, barely hanging
   from
   its rusted hinges, threatening to fall and shatter itself on the stone
   floor. The wall to the north is a crumbling testament to the power of
   time
   and neglect: what was once relied upon to protect the city from
   invaders is
   little more than a mound of stones that a small child could surmount.

   bringing

   Northern Road
   The stone tiles of this road have long since lost their form and
   structure: the road here is uneven and cracked, even missing in some
   parts.
   Broken stone and gravel speckle the road, causing each footfall to
   create
   an eery "crunching" sound. The main road runs north, towards the city
   gates, and south, towards the fountain and city square. A smaller road
   leads eastward towards the market.

   Old Tarsis Square
   Dead, dry moss fills the cracks near the remains of the old Tarsis
   fountain. The ruined fountain has long since dried up and is a broken
   shell
   of its former glory. The stone tiles that made up this square are
   shattered
   and broken; weeds have broken through some of the tiles and misplaced
   others, but even those are long-since dead, much like the rest of the

   The Tarsis Dump
   A forsaken desert surrounds you, swallows you whole with its forceful
   gales that hurl grains of sand deep into your skin. It is as if the
   wind is
   penetrating your bones. Scattered pieces of brick and stone have been
   discarded here in the dump. Where once a steady stream of horse-drawn
   cart
   would carry the refuse of tarsis to this forsaken landfill, nothing
   stirs.
   There is little here that is still useful, but the ancient bones of
   what
   you can assume were vagrants lie amidst the trash, with the hopes of
   their
   once peaceful lives covered with filth.

   624H 19V 13822X 1712C Exits:N> lA Shattered Gate
   The southern gates of Tarsis were once heavily fortified, reinforced
   steel, unlike their wooden counterparts at the north and east gates.
   These
   gates were made specifically to keep something out, and to make sure
   that
   it stayed out, especially since Icewall was to the south of this city
   before the Gods took it away. The heavy fortifications and magical
   enchantments on this gate are probably the only reason the gates still
   rest
   on their massive hinges, although those hinges have long since rusted
   solid.

   665H 55V 13822X 1712C Exits:N> lA Shattered Gate
   The southern gates of Tarsis were once heavily fortified, reinforced
   steel, unlike their wooden counterparts at the north and east gates.
   These
   gates were made specifically to keep something out, and to make sure
   that
   it stayed out, especially since Icewall was to the south of this city
   before the Gods took it away. The heavy fortifications and magical
   enchantments on this gate are probably the only reason the gates still
   rest
   on their massive hinges, although those hinges have long since rusted
   solid.

   and often and protected the cities inhabitants from the nomads and
   common
   criminals that dwelled within the Plains. Now the shattered gate stands

   Before the Library
   Two large wooden double doors in the southern wall once opened to
   scholars seeking the knowledge and wisdom that was housed within the
   Great
   Tarsis Library. Now only a single, beaten door remains, barely hanging
   from
   its rusted hinges, threatening to fall and shatter itself on the stone
   floor. The wall to the north is a crumbling testament to the power of
   time
   and neglect: what was once relied upon to protect the city from
   invaders is
   little more than a mound of stones that a small child could surmount.

   Wall Road
   Once there was an immense lookout tower at the northeast corner of
   Tarsis that provided city guards with a vantage point to survey the
   surrounding landscape. That tower collapsed inward, into the city,
   bringing
   a large section of the city wall with it. The entire road leading east
   is
   blocked by the fallen stone and rubble now, the only exits are a road
   leading south into the market, and west towards the northern gate.

   A Shattered Gate
   The southern gates of Tarsis were once heavily fortified, reinforced
   steel, unlike their wooden counterparts at the north and east gates.
   These
   gates were made specifically to keep something out, and to make sure
   that
   it stayed out, especially since Icewall was to the south of this city
   before the Gods took it away. The heavy fortifications and magical
   enchantments on this gate are probably the only reason the gates still
   rest
   on their massive hinges, although those hinges have long since rusted
   solid.

   The Tarsis Dump
   A forsaken desert surrounds you, swallows you whole with its forceful
   gales that hurl grains of sand deep into your skin. It is as if the
   wind is
   penetrating your bones. Scattered pieces of brick and stone have been
   discarded here in the dump. Where once a steady stream of horse-drawn
   cart
   would carry the refuse of tarsis to this forsaken landfill, nothing
   stirs.
   There is little here that is still useful, but the ancient bones of
   what
   you can assume were vagrants lie amidst the trash, with the hopes of
   their
   once peaceful lives covered with filth.

   penetrating your bones. Scattered pieces of brick and stone have been
   discarded here in the dump. Where once a steady stream of horse-drawn
   cart
   would carry the refuse of tarsis to this forsaken landfill, nothing
   stirs.
   There is little here that is still useful, but the ancient bones of
   what
   you can assume were vagrants lie amidst the trash, with the hopes of
   their
   once peaceful lives covered with filth.

   These
   gates were made specifically to keep something out, and to make sure
   that
   it stayed out, especially since Icewall was to the south of this city
   before the Gods took it away. The heavy fortifications and magical
   enchantments on this gate are probably the only reason the gates still
   rest
   on their massive hinges, although those hinges have long since rusted
   solid.

   The Tarsis Dump
   A forsaken desert surrounds you, swallows you whole with its forceful
   gales that hurl grains of sand deep into your skin. It is as if the
   wind is
   penetrating your bones. Scattered pieces of brick and stone have been
   discarded here in the dump. Where once a steady stream of horse-drawn
   cart
   would carry the refuse of tarsis to this forsaken landfill, nothing
   stirs.
   There is little here that is still useful, but the ancient bones of
   what

   their
   once peaceful lives covered with filth.

   Large, burned out craters speckle the marketplace here serving as an

   area
   was heavily targetted when the city was attacked because of the dense
   population of a crowded marketplace. The surrounding buildings are
   hollowed
   shells of their former glory: walls are filled with large holes, roofs
   have
   collapsed into several of the buildings, entryways have filled with
   rubble.

   Once there was an immense lookout tower at the northeast corner of
   Tarsis that provided city guards with a vantage point to survey the
   surrounding landscape. That tower collapsed inward, into the city,
   bringing
   a large section of the city wall with it. The entire road leading east
   is

   would-be attackers from the Plains of Dust. Guards would patrol this
   area
   and often and protected the cities inhabitants from the nomads and
   common
   criminals that dwelled within the Plains. Now the shattered gate stands
   as
   an eternal testament to their failure: the gate itself has long been
   torn
   out of its frame and shattered onto the stone road of the city.

   A massive, charred crater is all that remains of the southeastern part
   of the city. Whatever struck this city and left it in its ruined state
   must
   have rivaled the destructive force of the Cataclysm to have levelled
   this
   large a section of the city. Despite it's poor condition, the road
   leading
   west is in much better condition than the road that once lead eastward.

   A forsaken desert surrounds you, swallows you whole with its forceful
   gales that hurl grains of sand deep into your skin. It is as if the
   wind is
   penetrating your bones. Scattered pieces of brick and stone have been
   discarded here in the dump. Where once a steady stream of horse-drawn
   cart
   would carry the refuse of tarsis to this forsaken landfill, nothing
   stirs.
   There is little here that is still useful, but the ancient bones of
   what
   you can assume were vagrants lie amidst the trash, with the hopes of
   their
   once peaceful lives covered with filth.

   The Tarsis Wastelands
   Once, these Wastelands served as a walking ground for muggers,
   prostitutes, thieves and the like, but now it is dead and barren. The
   remains of a large ship that was grounded here can be seen to the

   but it had collapsed onto itself a long time ago, destroying whatever

   Before the Library
   Two large wooden double doors in the southern wall once opened to
   scholars seeking the knowledge and wisdom that was housed within the
   Great
   Tarsis Library. Now only a single, beaten door remains, barely hanging
   from
   its rusted hinges, threatening to fall and shatter itself on the stone
   floor. The wall to the north is a crumbling testament to the power of
   time
   and neglect: what was once relied upon to protect the city from
   invaders is
   little more than a mound of stones that a small child could surmount.

   bringing
   a large section of the city wall with it. The entire road leading east
   is
   blocked by the fallen stone and rubble now, the only exits are a road
   leading south into the market, and west towards the northern gate.

   The broken road continues westward, towards the Tarsis Wastelands which
   was once known for the vagrants and criminals that occupied the area.
   Now
   it, like the rest of the city, is barren and desolate. A road branches
   off
   to the south, leading towards the cities inn, while the main road leads
   eastward, towards the city square.

   The Tarsis Inn, to the west, is one of the few buildings that remains
   mostly intact. The sign that once hung above the inns door has nearly
   fallen from its perch: it hangs by a single hook now, ready to fall and
   shatter itself onto the cobblestone road.

   A Shattered Gate
   The southern gates of Tarsis were once heavily fortified, reinforced
   steel, unlike their wooden counterparts at the north and east gates.
   These
   gates were made specifically to keep something out, and to make sure
   that
   it stayed out, especially since Icewall was to the south of this city
   before the Gods took it away. The heavy fortifications and magical
   enchantments on this gate are probably the only reason the gates still
   rest
   on their massive hinges, although those hinges have long since rusted
   solid.

   The Tarsis Dump
   A forsaken desert surrounds you, swallows you whole with its forceful
   gales that hurl grains of sand deep into your skin. It is as if the
   wind is
   penetrating your bones. Scattered pieces of brick and stone have been
   discarded here in the dump. Where once a steady stream of horse-drawn
   cart
   would carry the refuse of tarsis to this forsaken landfill, nothing

   There is little here that is still useful, but the ancient bones of

   their
   once peaceful lives covered with filth.

   A Shattered Gate
   The southern gates of Tarsis were once heavily fortified, reinforced
   steel, unlike their wooden counterparts at the north and east gates.
   These
   gates were made specifically to keep something out, and to make sure
   that
   it stayed out, especially since Icewall was to the south of this city
   before the Gods took it away. The heavy fortifications and magical
   enchantments on this gate are probably the only reason the gates still
   rest
   on their massive hinges, although those hinges have long since rusted
   solid.

   it stayed out, especially since Icewall was to the south of this city
   before the Gods took it away. The heavy fortifications and magical
   enchantments on this gate are probably the only reason the gates still
   rest
   on their massive hinges, although those hinges have long since rusted
   solid.

   A Shattered Gate
   The southern gates of Tarsis were once heavily fortified, reinforced
   steel, unlike their wooden counterparts at the north and east gates.
   These
   gates were made specifically to keep something out, and to make sure
   that
   it stayed out, especially since Icewall was to the south of this city
   before the Gods took it away. The heavy fortifications and magical
   enchantments on this gate are probably the only reason the gates still
   rest
   on their massive hinges, although those hinges have long since rusted
   solid.

   North Gate
   The northern gate of Tarsis once stood as an inpenetrable boundary to
   would-be attackers from the Plains of Dust. Guards would patrol this
   area
   and often and protected the cities inhabitants from the nomads and
   common
   criminals that dwelled within the Plains. Now the shattered gate stands
   as
   an eternal testament to their failure: the gate itself has long been
   torn
   out of its frame and shattered onto the stone road of the city.

   Wall Road
   Once there was an immense lookout tower at the northeast corner of
   Tarsis that provided city guards with a vantage point to survey the
   surrounding landscape. That tower collapsed inward, into the city,
   bringing
   a large section of the city wall with it. The entire road leading east
   is
   blocked by the fallen stone and rubble now, the only exits are a road
   leading south into the market, and west towards the northern gate.

   Large, burned out craters speckle the marketplace here serving as an
   indication as to what happened to this mighty city. It is likely this
   area
   was heavily targetted when the city was attacked because of the dense
   population of a crowded marketplace. The surrounding buildings are
   hollowed
   shells of their former glory: walls are filled with large holes, roofs
   have

   The Tarsis Dump
   A forsaken desert surrounds you, swallows you whole with its forceful
   gales that hurl grains of sand deep into your skin. It is as if the
   wind is
   penetrating your bones. Scattered pieces of brick and stone have been
   discarded here in the dump. Where once a steady stream of horse-drawn
   cart
   would carry the refuse of tarsis to this forsaken landfill, nothing
   stirs.
   There is little here that is still useful, but the ancient bones of
   what
   you can assume were vagrants lie amidst the trash, with the hopes of
   their
   once peaceful lives covered with filth.

   A Shattered Gate
   The southern gates of Tarsis were once heavily fortified, reinforced
   steel, unlike their wooden counterparts at the north and east gates.
   These
   gates were made specifically to keep something out, and to make sure
   that
   it stayed out, especially since Icewall was to the south of this city
   before the Gods took it away. The heavy fortifications and magical
   enchantments on this gate are probably the only reason the gates still
   rest
   on their massive hinges, although those hinges have long since rusted
   solid.

   The Tarsis Dump
   A forsaken desert surrounds you, swallows you whole with its forceful
   gales that hurl grains of sand deep into your skin. It is as if the
   wind is
   penetrating your bones. Scattered pieces of brick and stone have been
   discarded here in the dump. Where once a steady stream of horse-drawn
   cart
   would carry the refuse of tarsis to this forsaken landfill, nothing
   stirs.
   There is little here that is still useful, but the ancient bones of
   what
   you can assume were vagrants lie amidst the trash, with the hopes of
   their
   once peaceful lives covered with filth.

   The Tarsis Dump
   A forsaken desert surrounds you, swallows you whole with its forceful
   gales that hurl grains of sand deep into your skin. It is as if the
   wind is
   penetrating your bones. Scattered pieces of brick and stone have been
   discarded here in the dump. Where once a steady stream of horse-drawn
   cart
   would carry the refuse of tarsis to this forsaken landfill, nothing
   stirs.
   There is little here that is still useful, but the ancient bones of
   what
   you can assume were vagrants lie amidst the trash, with the hopes of
   their
   once peaceful lives covered with filth.
