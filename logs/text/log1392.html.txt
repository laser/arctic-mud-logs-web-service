   the building exposed to the environment. The attached jail cells have

   The stone tiles of this road have long since lost their form and

   parts.
   Broken stone and gravel speckle the road, causing each footfall to
   create
   an eery "crunching" sound. The main road runs north, towards the city
   gates, and south, towards the fountain and city square. A smaller road
   leads eastward towards the market.

   fountain. The ruined fountain has long since dried up and is a broken

   The state of the road has long since fallen from its former grace. This
   once busy, bustling market road has seen few travelers in recent times.
   Skeletons of the buildings that once bordered the road are all that is
   left, save the restaurant to the east that has somehow, miraculously
   survived all this time.
